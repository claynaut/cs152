# CS152 Project Phase 2: Parser Generation Using bison
This is Phase 2 for a compiler project for CS152. Original specifications are authored by the TA for the course.


## Grammar for the MINI-L Language
The grammar is derived from the syntax diagrams provided by the TA, located [here](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~mafar001/compiler/webpages2/syntax.html). The grammar specification can be seen in detail in `mini_l_grammar.pdf`.

## Prerequisites

Run the Makefile to generate the necessary files. 
- Example: `make`

## Usage
The parser can be invoked by the following command.
- Example: `cat [.min file] | parser`
